# migrationmodels
R code for models in Mesoudi, A. (in prep) Migration, acculturation, and the maintenance of between-group cultural variation.

model1_acculturation_recursions.R contains R code for the recursion-based Model 1 examining the effect of migration, acculturation and assortation on between-group cultural variation in neutral cultural traits (measured with Fst). 

model2_cooperation_recursions.R contains R code for the recursion-based Model 2 examining the effect of migration, acculturation and assortation on between-group cultural variation in a cooperative cultural trait. 

model1b_acculturation_ABM.R contains R code for the agent-based version of Model 1 presented in the Supplementary Material.

Each file contains model code and scripts for creating the figures in the paper.
